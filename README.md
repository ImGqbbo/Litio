# Litio

NOTE: Make sure you have enabled all the 3 gateaway intents, otherwise the bot will not work.
How to use:
- Go info bin/Debug folder;
- Start Litio.exe;
- Invite the bot with application.commands scope (for slash commands);
- Enjoy :')

Thanks to GEFF and TheDemonTeam for helping me testing the bot. Go and checkout their projects and tools: https://github.com/TheDemonTeam.
